# Attendance-Management---OpenCV
It adds the student into a global database and marks the attendance of the each student using live camera or picture of the class.

# 1. Add the student into global database

Additional check for ambiguity is implemented, i.e. if a student tries to register himself/herself multiple times is restricted by the program.

# 2. Select the type by which you want to mark the attendance

This program allows you to mark the attendance in 3 different ways.
-> By giving the image paath of the existing image of the class.
-> By taking real time picture of the class using any webcam.
-> By starting the live camera and detecting the students in real time.

# 3. Generate report

->Report status of the class is generated in graphical format.
->Report status of individual student can be generated upon request.

# 4. Email notification

Students are continously monitered for their attendance for 70%(modifyable) mark. Any student as soon as crosses the mark, an email from PROJECTNAPSTER is generated and sent to their specified emails for warnings.
