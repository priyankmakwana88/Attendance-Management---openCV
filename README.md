# Attendance-Management---OpenCV
It adds the student into a global database and marks the attendance of the each student using live camera or picture of the class.

# 1. Add the student into global datbase
Additional check for ambiguity is implemented, i.e. if a student tries to register himself/herself multiple times is restricted by the program.

# 2. Select the type you want to mark the attendence
This program allows you to mark the attendence in 3 different ways.
-> By giving the image paath of the existing image of the class.
-> By taking real time picture of the class using any webcam.
-> By starting the live camera and detecting the students in real time.

After selecting the marking type, rest process is automated.
